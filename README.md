Alpha-Video-Chat
================
Our project is based on audio/video transmission & reception. Through our application two persons in an intranet can Chat with one another & they can have Video Chatting also.

For the connectivity of client with server we used JAVA Sockets. In this we store the information of a user in table format. Information consists of UserName and UserIPAddress.
Socket`s table consists of two columns one is username and other is userIPaddress. Server map username with its IPaddress to pass the data from one user to other.
We used Java Media Framework(JMF 2.1.1) for video chatting purpose. JMF help us to identify the webcam and to compress the pictures to send it over a network with ease.
